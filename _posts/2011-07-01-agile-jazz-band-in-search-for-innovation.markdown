I often compare Agile and Innovation to a Music Band, as a "m√©lomane" music lover and occasional guitar player, I think there is many similarities:

A Band is self-organized

* Each Band player know themself intimately
* They are cross functional

They master their instruments

* They practice daily
* They are passionate, its emotional


They explore their scales and sounds continuously to find their personal sound, the riff, the melody that will make a great song that people will love and never forget

* They explore and experiment
* They look for patterns and analogies
* They change old things in new ways
* Its a progressive/iterative process

They perform in artistic environment

* This artistic environment help their creativity

Innovation in music is incredibly subjective in our modern Music industry, it can be as "simple" as a "Band like" which perform very well and differently of what other have made in the past to a completely revolutionary band bringing a new musical style.
