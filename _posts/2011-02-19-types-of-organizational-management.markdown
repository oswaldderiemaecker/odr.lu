## Agile Organization:

The agile enterprise strives to make change a routine part of organizational life to reduce or eliminate the organizational trauma that paralyzes many businesses attempting to adapt to new markets and environments. Because change is perpetual, the agile enterprise is able to nimbly adjust to and take advantage of emerging opportunities. The agile enterprise views itself as an integral component of a larger system whose activities produce a ripple effect of change both within the enterprise itself and the broader system.

One type of enterprise architecture that supports agility is a non-hierarchical organization without a single point of control. Individuals function autonomously, constantly interacting with each other to define the work that needs to be done. Roles and responsibilities are not predetermined but rather emerge from individualsâ€™ self-organizing activities and are constantly in flux. Similarly, projects are generated everywhere in the enterprise, sometimes even from outside affiliates. Key decisions are made collaboratively, on the spot, and on the fly. Because of this, knowledge, power, and intelligence are spread through the enterprise, making it uniquely capable of quickly recovering and adapting to the loss of any key enterprise component.

In business, projects can be complex with uncertain outcomes and goals can change over time. Traditionally these issues were dealt with by planning experts that would attempt to pre-determine every possible detail prior to implementation; however, in many situations, even the most carefully thought out projects will be impossibly difficult to manage. Agile techniques, originating from the software development community, represent a alternative approach to the classic prescriptive planning approaches to management. The main focus of agile methods is to address the issues of complexity, uncertainty, and dynamic goals, by making planning and execution work in parallel rather than in sequence to eliminate unnecessary planning activity, and the resulting unnecessary work.

Agile methods integrate planning with execution allowing an organization to "search" for an optimal ordering of work tasks and to adjust to changing requirements. The major causes of chaos on a project include incomplete understanding of project components, incomplete understanding of component interactions and changing requirements. Sometimes requirements change as a greater understanding of the project components unfolds over time. Requirements also change due to changing needs and wants of the stakeholders. The agile approach allows a team or organization to implement successful projects quickly by only focusing on a small set of details in any change iteration. This is in contrast to non-agile approaches in which all the details necessary for completion have equal priority inside of one large iteration.

## Matrix Organization:

The idea of a matrix organization specifically refers to any organization in which the project manager or project team leader actually shares responsibility for the project with a number of individual functional managers. The shared responsibilities in a matrix organization include but are not limited to the acts of assigning priorities and tasks to individual project team members, directing the course of action of either individuals or groups of project team members.

## Functional Organization:
The term functional organization is used specifically for the purpose of describing a hierarchal group, company, or organization in which it is determined that each individual and particular employee should be charged with the task of defining an individual and unique person who will serve as the organizational leader and/or manager.

## Functional Manager:
The term functional manager is one that is of crucial and critical importance to the project team and to the project leader as it most appropriately allows for an accurate representation of the actual chain of command. The functional manager refers specifically to the individual or the individuals who have management authority (or serve in that capacity) over the particular organizational unit within a functional group, company, or organization.

## Projectized Organization:
A projectized organization refers specifically to the particular and specific organization in question that has been built through the utilization of an organizational structure that has been set up in a manner in which the project manager leads the group and in which the project manager has the ultimate authority to make any and all   decisions involving the organization, including, but no necessarily limited to, the assignment of all priorities, the application of any predesignated resources, and also any and all direct workings of persons that have been assigned to the project already or may be assigned in the future.
