For preparing my Redhat Certified System Administrator exam, I have used a white board as a learning tool, this is another example of the importance of having visual tools, my white board was always there catching my eyes, this helped me to review each topics, using magnetic dots to identify topics which required some more learning.

Of course learning the commands is important but practicing is even more. So practice, practice, don't assume you know it.

Here a picture of my white board:
