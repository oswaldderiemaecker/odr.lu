First estimations are estimations, and will always be just an estimation.

Using hours to estimate a work to do is very complicated and very subjective from person to person.

I instead use Relative Points, this is comparing the effort for finishing a feature based on past similar feature and give them Effort points that represent the effort to achieve them till done.

**How to start:**

1. Ask your developers/managers to write down on sticky notes, a series of features that you have developed since 3 month ago, from small to large, explain that the larger should not take longer than 5 days, and that they must be done! It helps to define what "Done" means :) Let's say in production. Also ensure that the features are product features with business value and not technical tasks.
2. Gives them around 15 minutes to generates as much stickies as possible.
3. Put those stikies on the table and take one, ask each developers to rate it on a scale of 1, 2, 3 5, 8 and 13 (Fibonacci) , one being no effort, 13 being a lot more effort. If it's above 13 then the feature cannot be estimated. Ideally use Planning poker for this.
4. Do this with all the sticky notes.
5. After 40 mins, you should have a set of rated features by Effort point.

You can now use this as a reference to estimate your future features.

During development, you then count the number of points you did during a time boxed that you have fixed in advance, it is usually called a sprint.

**In exemple:**

You have planned for features having 1+3+8+3 Effort points, your sprint worth 15 Effort points.
Let's say that your sprint is 10 days and your team have finished 12 effort points, you can surely plan your next sprints with 12 points and with this indicator, do project forecasting for the business.

**Important things:**

Slice your project to small feature following the INVEST format, Independant, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small and Testable, keep that in mind, it all makes sense.
Update your features Effort points references from time to time.
Read Agile Estimation and Planning a very very good book and start estimate differently :)
