Why should we use Visual Management ?

* It foster communication
* It makes the work visible to everybody
* It makes the process visible to everybody
* It highlights process problems to everybody
* The key of visual management is looking for a reaction. If the process isnâ€™t functioning as expected, what will we do about it ?

Also visualize the processes and ask you how they can be measured ?

* The Cycle-time, how long an item takes from the input to the output ?
* Count of item categories per iteration, what is the ratio business value/maintenance ?
* What is the lead-time ? Items in WIP standing in line, waiting their turn for processing, the longer the line, the longer they will have to wait
